## Hi, I’m Warren

I’m an IT Service Desk Engineer working in the healthcare sector, with a focus on reliable IT service delivery, Netorking, and core Windows infrastructure fundamentals.

This GitHub profile contains small projects and lab work I use to reinforce practical understanding outside of my day-to-day role.

### Areas of focus

- IT service desk workflows and structured troubleshooting  
- Networking fundementals  
- Windows infrastructure fundamentals (Active Directory, networking basics)  
- Learning through hands on lab work and documentation

### Homelab & infrastructure practice

I maintain a personal Windows based homelab to strengthen my understanding of infrastructure concepts that surface in real world support environments.

This includes:
- Windows Server (AD DS, DHCP, DNS, RRAS)
- Hyper-V virtualisation
- Multi subnet and multi site simulations
- Practicing realistic support and fault finding scenarios

### Projects

**Riverside Home Lab**  
A Windows Server based homelab used to practice Active Directory, networking, and support oriented infrastructure scenarios in a simulated multi site environment.

**CGM data exploration (early stage)**  
Early work exploring CGM data structures and formats to better understand data quality, cleaning challenges, and potential digital health use cases.  
Currently paused while I focus on infrastructure and support fundamentals.

### Background & approach

Alongside my professional role, I bring long term personal insight into healthcare technology through lived experience with Type 1 Diabetes, which has shaped an interest in digital health systems and data reliability.

I value clear documentation, calm problem-solving, and steady skill progression over novelty.
